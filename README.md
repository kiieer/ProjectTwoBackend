# Bikini Bottom

## Project Description
For project 2, we were given the opportunity to develop our own project requirements. Our team decided to create a hotel website that requires users, reservations, and offers a variety of sign up options. We have room service, daily themed events, and plenty of restaurants for you to wine and dine. Primarily, we used Angular for front end development and Java with Spring Boot for the back end functionality. 

## Technologies Used
  * This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.
  * Java version 1.8
  * Spring Boot version 2.6.7
  * Springdoc Open API version 1.6.8
  * PostGreSQL version 42.3.1
  * HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

## Features
Below are the features successfully implemented in this website. We will continue to work on the tasks in the todo list to complete all the requirements.

  1. User can register with name, email, username, password, and phone number.
  2. User can login and logout of the homepage.
  3. User can preview and update his or her reservations.
  4. User can create new password based upon email.

### To Do List
  1. User can recover password.
  2. User can sign up for daily events.
  3. User can order room service.
  4. User can subscribe to mailing list.
  5. User can update/delete existing reservations.

* Copy the above URL into GitBash terminal.
* Access working directory using command ``-cd <directory-name>``.
* Clone local repository using ``git clone <URL>`` and press enter.
* Open this cloned repository from the directory in Visual Studio Code.
* In VS Code terminal, run the command ``npm install``.
* Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to this [link](http://localhost:4200/). The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Usage

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
